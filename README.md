Using Arduino and its components, I created a Temperature and Humidity Module with various functions along with displaying the temperature and humidity.

Components: Arduino UNO board, LCD screen display, DHT temperature and humidity module, fan blade with dc motor and powersupply, joystick

Description: The DHT temperature and humidity module measures the humidity and temperature of its surroundings which I was able to display onto the led screen display. The display has 3 outputs: the default output shows the temperature and humidity, the next output shows only the temperature and temperature status ranging from cold, cool, mild, warm, and hot depending on what the temperature is, and the third output shows only the humidity and humidity status ranging from low, good, great, and high depending on what the humidity is. The display output can be changed by shifting the joystick to the left or right. In addition you can also change from fahrenheit to celsius and vice versa by shifting the joystick up or down. The screen is also accompanied by LED lights that respond based on the display status. Lastly, this project has a fan which will automatically turn on if the temperature status is warm or hot.
